 * Generate a safe version of the provided URL

 * Images that Calypso uses have to be provided by a trusted TLS host. To do
 * this, we check the host of the URL against a list of allowed hosts, and run the image
 * through photon if the host name does not match.
 *
 * NOTE: This function will return `null` for external URLs with query strings,
 * because Photon itself does not support this!
 *
 * @param  url The URL to secure
 * @returns The secured URL, or `null` if we couldn't make it safe
